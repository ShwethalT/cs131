Hello! This is my mini project on whether we can statistically identify what makes the perfect banana!

The csv file is the dataset.

Metadata.py is a python script created in a linux environment and runs with command python metadata.py which overwrites a new metadata.txt file each run.

Some EDA plots that can be included as part of metadata are included in the a5.ipynb

a5.ipynb is a python notebook that contains the code.

Meaningful plots - Scatterplots (interactive!), Confusion Matrix, Boxplots (interactive!), Violin plots (interactive!)

Statistical Analysis - Correlation #nontrivial finding

Model- Random Forest Classifier #nontrivial finding
